## Project Overview
This project simulates a high-precision geological survey workflow. I built a Machine Learning classifier to identify mineral/sample categories based on chemical composition. This work mirrors the quantitative chemical data processing (XRF analysis) I performed at the **Ministry of Petroleum and Mining**.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python (Google Colab)
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier

## Key Results
* **Accuracy:** 100% on test data.
* **Primary Predictor:** Identified **Flavanoids** (chemical markers) as the most significant feature for classification using Feature Importance analysis.
* **Reliability:** Validated results through a Confusion Matrix and Detailed Classification Report.

## Real-World Application
This model can be used to:
1. Automate mineral identification in mining operations.
2. Detect non-conforming items in chemical manufacturing (relevant to **FMCG/Warehouse** roles).
3. Streamline groundwater quality risk segmentation.
