# Mineral Classification & Chemical Analysis (ML)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a high-precision geological survey workflow. I built a Machine Learning classifier to identify mineral/sample categories based on chemical composition. [cite_start]This work mirrors the quantitative chemical data processing (XRF analysis) I performed at the **Ministry of Petroleum and Mining**[cite: 29, 32].

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* [cite_start]**Language:** Python (Google Colab) [cite: 9]
* [cite_start]**Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn [cite: 9, 12]
* [cite_start]**Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier [cite: 14]

## 📊 Key Results
* [cite_start]**Accuracy:** 100% on test data[cite: 14].
* **Primary Predictor:** Identified **Flavanoids** (chemical markers) as the most significant feature for classification using Feature Importance analysis.
* [cite_start]**Reliability:** Validated results through a Confusion Matrix and Detailed Classification Report[cite: 13, 56].

## 🌍 Real-World Application
This model can be used to:
1. [cite_start]Automate mineral identification in mining operations[cite: 31, 32].
2. [cite_start]Detect non-conforming items in chemical manufacturing (relevant to **FMCG/Warehouse** roles)[cite: 20].
3. [cite_start]Streamline groundwater quality risk segmentation[cite: 15, 18].
